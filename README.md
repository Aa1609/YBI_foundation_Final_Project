Title: Mileage Prediction : Regression Analysis

Here's summary of my Project:

The Mileage Prediction - Regression Analysis project aimed to develop an accurate regression model to predict the mileage (fuel efficiency) of vehicles based on various input features. The project utilized historical data on different vehicles, including model_year, weight, horsepower, and other relevant attributes.

The project followed a rigorous process of data preprocessing, feature selection, and engineering to identify the most influential factors affecting mileage. Through extensive model training, validation, and fine-tuning, the project achieved an outstanding accuracy rate of 85.2869%.

The high accuracy of the model holds significant implications for various stakeholders. Consumers can now make well-informed decisions when purchasing vehicles, considering both fuel efficiency and environmental factors. Automobile manufacturers can leverage insights from the model to optimize vehicle designs, enhance fuel economy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Moreover, the project's emphasis on sustainability aligns with broader environmental goals. Encouraging the adoption of more fuel-efficient vehicles contributes to reducing the overall carbon footprint and mitigating the impact of transportation on climate change.

Overall, the Mileage Prediction - Regression Analysis project demonstrates the efficacy and relevance of machine learning techniques in addressing real-world challenges in the automotive sector. The model's accuracy ensures its applicability in various domains, facilitating better decision-making, fostering sustainability, and paving the way for a greener and more efficient future.
